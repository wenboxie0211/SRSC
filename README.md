Airtical: Hierarchical clustering by aggregating representatives in sub-minimum-spanning-trees

Abstract: Data explosion makes it difficult for people to intuitively analyze the data and excavate its essence. Therefore, many data analysis methods, e.g., clustering, were proposed to deal with data mining tasks in different fields. As one of the classical branch in clustering methods, hierarchical clustering are widely applied in various fields of scientific analysis. However, it is hard for hierarchical clustering to balance the complexity and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a parameter free clustering algorithm based on scoring the reciprocal nearest data points. Extensive experiments on UCI datasets show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than other benchmark algorithms. We further analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithm, proving that its time-complexity is O(n\log n) in multi-dimension datasets meanwhile its space-complexity is O(\log n).
